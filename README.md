# ShadowFlip

**ShadowFlip** is a web-based Chinese Chess (Xiangqi) game that introduces a unique "dark chess" variant, where pieces are hidden at the beginning of the game and only reveal their true identities once they move or capture an opponent's piece. This twist on the classic game adds an exciting layer of strategy and mystery to the traditional Chinese Chess experience.

## Features

- **Dark Chess Variant**: Pieces start hidden and are revealed only when moved or captured.
- **Interactive Gameplay**: Play against an AI or another player in a dynamic, visually engaging game environment.
- **Undo and Draw Options**: Mistakes can be undone, and the game can be drawn if both players agree.
- **Music & Sound Effects**: Enjoy immersive background music and sound effects that enhance the gameplay experience.
- **Responsive Design**: The game is fully playable on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

## How to Play

1. **Start the Game**: Click the "Start Game" button to begin.
2. **Make Your Move**: Click on a piece to select it, then click on the destination to move it. Hidden pieces will reveal their true identity once they make a move.
3. **Capture Pieces**: Capture your opponent’s pieces by landing on their square. Captured pieces will be displayed at the bottom of the screen.
4. **Special Moves**: Certain pieces have unique movement rules, like the “cannon” or “knight.”
5. **End the Game**: The game ends when one player captures the opponent’s "king" (将/帅), or if both players agree to a draw.

## How to Play Dark Chess

In **ShadowFlip**, all pieces except for the kings (帅 and 将) are initially hidden behind a "?" symbol. The pieces remain hidden until they make their first move or capture an opponent's piece. Once revealed, the piece follows the standard movement rules of Chinese Chess.
